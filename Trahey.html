"Among the less obvious ways that archaeology has expanded our view of Mediterranean antiquity has been the revelation that magical practices were a familiar part of everyday life. Although literary evidence had long suggested as much, scholarly faith in the "rationalism" of the Greek and Roman elites was such that most people regarded magic as, by definition, a marginal phenomenon, current only among the ignorant and gullible lower classes or resulting from the increasing "Oriental" influence of the imperial period." </li>

<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Society_for_the_Promotion_of_Elfish_Welfare#Other_languages">The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (S.P.E.W.)</a> was an organisation founded in 1994 by Hermione Granger in response to what she saw as gross injustice in the treatment of house-elves at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.[1]

Having been deeply upset at the treatment and general prospects of house-elves, both in Hogwarts and the rest of the wizarding world, Hermione set up S.P.E.W. in order to champion their rights and question their standing in wizarding law and Elf Legislation. Hermione originally wanted to call the organisation "Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status". Since it would not fit on a badge, it was given its current name, though the original name was retained as the heading of the group's manifesto.
